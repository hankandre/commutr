#Commutr
Commutr is an application to help employees track their commutes to work. It's primarily meant to be a tracker for
runs, cycling, and other athletic modes of transportation, but isn't excluded to those. Currently it is connected to the
Strava API.

#### Updating UI
The former UI was pretty ugly. It was thrown together in a day to fulfill the bare minimum in order to get Commutr up
and running. The new UI will be much more approachable. It will include a Landing Page on top of the other views
originally in the app (login, register, and dashboard).

While I'm doing this I'm also refactoring the files. Originally my application was organized by type.
Controllers were in a *Controllers* directory, Factories in a *Factories* directory, etc. In the updated application the
files will be structured by feature. Everything having to do with authentication will be in the *authentication* directory.

On top the aforementioned changes, I'm refactoring
